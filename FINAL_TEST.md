# 🎯 WORDLE PROJECT - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION TEST

## ✅ **ALL REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED**

### **1. Game Mode: Player guesses secret word**
- ✅ Gray: letter not in word
- ✅ Yellow: letter in word but wrong position  
- ✅ Green: letter in correct position
- ✅ Proper duplicate letter handling (fixed color logic bug)

### **2. Easy Difficulty**
- ✅ Warns when player uses invalid words
- ✅ **Detects contradictory answers** (NEW: just implemented!)
- ✅ Helpful hints and tips
- ✅ Duplicate letter education

### **3. Expert Difficulty** 
- ✅ **Program can "lie" once with incorrect colors** (30% chance per guess)
- ✅ Shows message: "🤔 Something feels... different about this result..."
- ✅ Only lies once per game
- ✅ Tracks lying state properly

### **4. Assistant Mode**
- ✅ **Program tries to guess player's secret word**
- ✅ **Uses optimal strategy** (letter frequency analysis)
- ✅ **Eliminates maximum words each turn** (shows progress)
- ✅ **Detects contradictory color responses** (NEW: just implemented!)
- ✅ Smart first guess: "SOARE" (high-frequency letters)

### **5. Bonus Features Implemented**
- ✅ MTL monad stack (StateT + ReaderT + ExceptT + IO)
- ✅ 14,855+ word dictionary
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Interactive user interface
- ✅ Educational hints and tips

## 🧪 **TEST SCENARIOS**

### **Test 1: Expert Mode Lying**
```bash
printf "1\n3\nHELLO\nWORLD\nquit\n" | cabal run wordle
```
**Expected**: Computer lies once and shows "🤔 Something feels... different..."

### **Test 2: Easy Mode Contradiction Detection**  
```bash
printf "1\n1\nHELLO\nHELLO\nquit\n" | cabal run wordle
```
**Expected**: Warns about contradictory letter results

### **Test 3: Assistant Mode Intelligence**
```bash
printf "2\n\nRRRRR\nGGGGG\n" | cabal run wordle
```
**Expected**: Computer makes smart guesses and wins

### **Test 4: Assistant Mode Contradiction Detection**
```bash
printf "2\n\nRRRRR\nGRRRR\n" | cabal run wordle  
```
**Expected**: Computer detects contradictory feedback

## 🏆 **PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE**

All original requirements have been successfully implemented with advanced features:

1. ✅ **Core Wordle Logic**: Perfect color calculation with duplicate letter handling
2. ✅ **Three Difficulty Modes**: Easy (helpful), Normal (standard), Expert (lying)
3. ✅ **Assistant Mode**: Intelligent computer player with optimal strategy
4. ✅ **Contradiction Detection**: Both in Easy mode and Assistant mode
5. ✅ **Advanced Architecture**: Clean MTL monad stack implementation
6. ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
7. ✅ **User Experience**: Clear interface with helpful messages

The project demonstrates advanced Haskell concepts including:
- **Monad Transformers** (MTL)
- **State Management** 
- **Constraint Satisfaction**
- **AI Strategy Implementation**
- **Error Handling**
- **Interactive Programming**
